  summary: A tool for the generation of events in high-energy collisions
  description: |
    The Pythia program is a standard tool for the generation of events in
    high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for
    the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multiparticle
    final state. It contains a library of hard processes, models for initial-
    and final-state parton showers, matching and merging methods between hard
    processes and parton showers, multiparton interactions, beam remnants,
    string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities
    and several interfaces to external programs.
